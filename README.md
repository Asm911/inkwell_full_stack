This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project written to fetch data from a GraphQL endpoint and render it as a grid to the frontend client. Implemented cmmitlint commits. 
## Getting Started

First build the dependences for the application:
npm run build

Second start the server:
npm run start
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.


I would convert my application to use TypeScript and correct caching with more time.
